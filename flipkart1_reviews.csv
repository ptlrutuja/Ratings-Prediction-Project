67,Very Good,"The design and build quality seems premium. The size is smaller than average laptops as it is 14inch. Note that it is made in China, although the brand is of Hong Kong.

The keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.

Same goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.

In long run this will obviousl...

When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.,4

1012,Very Good with few caveats,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart",4
1013,Battery problem solution !,I am using this laptop from past 2 months and my overall experience is good with this product and i see lots of peoples are complaining about its battery life. I am not sure about others products but mine is good .You can try installing NVIDIA geforce gaming drivers for better battery life . It happened with me when i installed studio drivers my battery drains with in 1 hour and after installing again gaming drivers my battery life enhance upto 4 to 5 hours on normal usage.,5

- Keyboard and trackpad are pretty good
- RTX 1650 can handle almost all games at 1080P. GTA V can run at high(not ultra) settings,
- Display is not so great but sure value for money (More than good for everyday use, if you want extra precession use a external monitor)

Only con I noticed is with the colour of the display some colours are not so perfect but it is not a con which makes us difficult to use the lap and it can't be noticed easily

Highly recommended laptop below 55k👍",5
1086,Wonderful,Day 1 of purchase - The laptop looks way Awsome in real then on photoes ... The laptop is fast and boots up just in 6-10 seconds thanks to the SSD that is ! At this price the laptop is quite decent.. Only thing I hated was that in just an hour of gaming it heated up like a freaking heater...,4
1087,Classy product,"Good product at this price range. Quick boot with less than 6 seconds. Upto 6 hours of battery backup for normal use. No heating issues. Good speed, anti glare screen are added advantages. Overall value for your money.",5

1089,Wonderful,"Writing this after 3 months of heavy usage.
Pros :
Display was very good
Core i5+GTX1650 plays heavy games very well
Backlit keyboard
Great for heavy coding

Cons :
Battery :(
Nothing else

Tips :
Add extra 8GB ram for video editors
Buy extra HDD or SSD for more storage as 512GB gets full fast. :D

Overall :
Best product with great display, great for students, and for eSports players too😃",5
1090,Very Good,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.,4

1093,Awesome,"A very nice laptop with good display . Also very well performed in day to day activities as well as gaming.
Definitely worth for money. Buy it!!!",5
1094,Nice product,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.,4
1095,Pretty good,"After using 2 days -:

Perfomance - good
Battery - ok
Display -good
Build quality : could ve been better

My opinion about this lap : if you want good gaming with other works go for this. Don't expect battery from this laptop and build quilty is also not that great. Buy this lap when it's price is under 53k ...

Advice to Gamers.(To avoid overheating of CPU)

Go to power Settings and Advanced and reduce the CPU usage to 80%.(while gaming)

Also Try to play Game on Max settings possible for you with 50-60fps.That will really help you maintain CPU temperature around 60-65°c

I have played AC Valhalla, Odyssey,DMC5,Sekiro,Forza and everything runs well.

400 hours of Total Gameplay on AC Valhalla & Odyssey and I am not facing any issues.",5

7. Takes 10 seconds to boot up.
8. Don't open too many programs at once, it will become slow.
9. You should have patience like an ITC Investor when opening a website/link in Chrome new tab.

1853,Wonderful,"The product is worth the money spend for it. Due to 4gb ram, it looks like that the system is slow. But overall performance is very good. Design is good. No DVD writer is provided. Power back up is enough",5
1854,Does the job,"Good laptop as you have seen in the other reviews that it is for lite use like online classes, surfing and a bit of office work is exel and word otherwise you can't expect much more to this...",3
1855,Value-for-money,Good for normal use like watching movies you have be more patient working over internet because it makes it lag its a good thing that it has pentium quad core but clock speed is only 1.11ghz which is very low uninstall the macafee antivirus which comes along it will increase the the speed a little bit,4
1856,Pretty good,Best at <20k this is my second quad core (earlier with 2gb ram) works fine with updates closed & antivirus deactivated.keyboard should have been black for perfect 5/5 ratings.,4
1857,Just okay,It's suppose to be a quad core processor but it doesn't work like that only good for the most basic stuff like watching videos and Daily computing stuff I'm disappointed that it's can even play basic games like csgo or valorant,3
1858,Highly recommended,"Very stylish and slim design . System speed is very very good . It boot up in 5 seconds . Very easy to perform multi tasking . Till now not faced any lag . Battery backup is also 5 hours on moderate usage .

Aura RGB effect on keyboard looks great. It is easy to carry as it doesn't feel heavy at all. GTA5 runs superb without any single lag that too on power saver mode.

But battery life of gaming laptops are not that good everybody knows. It has two variants , the 1650ti will cost you 66k which i think is not worth it, because 1650ti has a very slight performance difference as compare to 1650. So you should go for 1650 and then install ram and hdd which will cost you around 6-7k",5
2031,Best in the market!,"Doesn't feel like a i5, feels like you're using a high end desktop.

Battery is low which is understandable since it's a gaming laptop.

The most amazing feature i like about this laptop is it's highly customisable, if you need to work and don't want too much power just use silent mode or windows mode, it will put the gpu to power saving mode.

If you want to play games use performance or turbo mode.

Modes can be setup of games also, like using fps mode for games like CSGO and rpg mode for A...

Overall very happy with the purchase. Also got the Windows 11 update within a week. Flipkart delivered it in two days with proper packaging.

3693,Waste of money!,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop.

Viewing angles are better than most of the competition but the colors look cartoonistic and is not accurate, human skin subjects look paintish and over saturated.

4364,Moderate,The quality of the laptop body is questionable. If you lift this laptop from the right end the lower part of the body made from cheap plastic makes sound. The laptop hinges are very bad. After few months it can break. Also the speaker makes some constant noise when played any video from YouTube. Also the laptop is china made. So if you went for dell thinking its a non Chinese brand thats not the case. Better go for HP or Lenovo.,2

A drawback which i noticed is that battery backup is not very good and it just drains completely within 2 hours (of gameplay). Apart from that, the product is top notch.",4
4490,Wonderful,Recently I bought this laptop and I find it perfect for gamers and persons with heavy duty. Cooling system is highlight in this system. I assure this laptop reaches your expectations and also great value for u r money. I strongly recommend people to go for it.,5
4491,Excellent,"I am writing this review after three weeks of usage. I bought this laptop for doing Deep Learning Projects. I am very much satisfied with the performance.

4496,Simply awesome,"After using this laptop for almost 1 month, i am giving this review.

Laptop can run AAA games like Valorant and GTA V without any lag, but settings need to be changed in DRAGON CENTER. Since laptop uses RTX 3060 and 144hz, it will use most of the battery power, so always need to plugged in while playing most games. Just buy a Cooler Pad, if you are playing for too long and so if you expect longer battery, please restrict yourselves.

For long run Intel i7 10th gen is very good, with 16gb RAM...

4497,Fabulous!,"Was sceptical to buy this, as it didn't have any product reviews, but damn I'm happy now.. I bought it for gaming and personal use, but it looks so sleek and the matte shine is just amazing, red backlit keypad..
Over-all you just need a cooling pad if you are running games in high specs, but for me CS GO, Dota 2, Pubg and Apex legends..they are running smoothly at even high graphics.. I still play in medium or low..
You won't be disappointed at all.",5

5498,Budget King for me,"Budget King right now, it is having 8Gb RAM, i3 11th Gen, and 512 SSD in this much amount.

The battery is also good in normal usage, it gives 4.5 hrs of backup and thanks to 65w fast charging also.

Bootup is very fast, in 5-7 secs only.

The sound is Normal because speakers are placed downside of it, but it sounds ok and clear when you place it on the table.

The display is also good and the overall design is so light to carry.",5
5499,Great product,"We bought Two! That itself should tell you how happy we are with this product!

5502,Mind-blowing purchase,"Apparently, I'm running out of words to describe it so I've given rating. At first blush, I got fascinated with the backlit keyboard ✨ that was so enchanting and then arrives the touch experience of the trackpad of the laptop, it was smooth as silk.

5975,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range.

5980,Good,"Pros:
Excellent battery life
Display has punchy and pleasing colours
Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

Excellent battery life
Display has punchy and pleasing colours
Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

•The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phone😇. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌",4
7854,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
7855,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5

Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it.",4
7925,Excellent,Good and fantastic and very happy and lovely mobile,5
7926,Moderate,"Camera is not good as campare to sumsung M20
And m11
Mic receptivity not good
Not good product on this range",2
7927,Nice product,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11",4
7928,Terrific,"Very good phone at this budget. After 10 days if usage my honest review are below

Pros
1. Very good build quality
2. Decent display
3. Very good battery back up
4. Decent back camera under good lighted condition ( for this price range)
5. Good sound quality while playing music

Cons
1. Front camera become little whitish in picture
2. During low light camera performance degrades",5
7929,Nice,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3
7930,Worth every penny,Very good product. Value for money. Battery back up is strong. Awesome display. Sound quality is very good and loud.,5
7931,Must buy!,It is a very good and velue for money smart phone....... best quality camera and best battery as well as bast display in this price segment ant it has exynos 850 it is a good processor of all rounding 👌 i use this phone continues 2 months and i really impressed it's service . It has Android 11 with one ui 3.1 . One ui 3.1 is a extremely good ui and my one of the favorite ui . So i extremely suggest you this phone,5
7932,Delightful,Good product in this price range but not so good for gaming ...brilliant camera..and nice performance overall nice mobile...,4
7933,Super!,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent",5
7934,Classy product,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.,5
7935,Value-for-money,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive.
Camera quality is good in this price point.
Performance is also good in this range
Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it.
Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it.",4
7936,Super!,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ...

7937,Hated it!,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

7938,Classy product,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.

•The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

•I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

•The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

• Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",5
7939,Value-for-money,"Review after 3 month of use:

1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5
2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5
3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5
4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5",4

7942,Brilliant,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof 😍
Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5

8543,Really Nice,"Purchase worth it. Review after 1 month of use.

Performance: Good & smooth
Battery: decent backup with normal whole days phone calls. Lasts about 36 hrs straight. Fast charging is good.

Camera is very interesting. AI shorts are total disaster.

UI and ease of use: Too good.

Sounds are best.

Connectivity is good. 5G not yet tested.

You can buy it if you are looking for a budget phone with great latest features.",4
8544,Simply awesome,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.,5

•I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

•The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5
8933,Good choice,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phone😇. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌",4
8934,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
8935,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5

2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.

Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use",5
8977,Simply awesome,"I wanted a good configuration mobile at the least possible price. There were good and bad reviews for it online. But I decided to purchase it because of brand name Samsung.

After about a month I am writing this review that it is one of the best mobile at this price range. It's an confirmation that none of a mobile can be available at this price even Chinese but this is Korian so its good like anything..

If you are a samsung fan you can go for it but if not you should definitely go for the POCO M3 it is better than this phone, it's display is full hd where as samsung F12 has only has hd display and all other features are same but inters of Design definitely POCO M3 wins.",5
9000,Absolute rubbish!,"Like it's camera is is like 48mp.
It's take too much time to charge.
I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung .
It's has very less features.
It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter.
It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.
I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG.",1

If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11",4

Pros
1. Very good build quality
2. Decent display
3. Very good battery back up
4. Decent back camera under good lighted condition ( for this price range)
5. Good sound quality while playing music

Cons
1. Front camera become little whitish in picture
2. During low light camera performance degrades",5
9009,Nice,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3
9010,Worth every penny,Very good product. Value for money. Battery back up is strong. Awesome display. Sound quality is very good and loud.,5
9011,Must buy!,It is a very good and velue for money smart phone....... best quality camera and best battery as well as bast display in this price segment ant it has exynos 850 it is a good processor of all rounding 👌 i use this phone continues 2 months and i really impressed it's service . It has Android 11 with one ui 3.1 . One ui 3.1 is a extremely good ui and my one of the favorite ui . So i extremely suggest you this phone,5
9012,Delightful,Good product in this price range but not so good for gaming ...brilliant camera..and nice performance overall nice mobile...,4
9013,Super!,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent",5
9014,Classy product,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.,5
9015,Value-for-money,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive.
Camera quality is good in this price point.
Performance is also good in this range
Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it.
Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it.",4
9016,Super!,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ...

9017,Hated it!,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

9018,Classy product,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.

•The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

•I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

•The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

• Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",5

1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5

3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5

Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5

Many people have criticized it's display because it's old TFT technology but display is quite good and on par with most of IPS displays.
Main USP of this phone is it's software. Other brands provide a bit better specs at the same price but they lack on UI and software updates. Samsung is better in this case with regular updates.
Samsung pay is really useful and way more faster and convenient to use than any other payment app.

The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌",4
10734,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
10735,Worth every penny,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5

10787,Decent product,"If I am going with brand name SAMSUNG then it should be like super but in samsung f12 disappointed me . It's camera quality is not good ,it is 48 mp camera .
If anybody want to buy this for thinking good camera I recommended to go with Realme.
Battery backup also less .",3
10788,Must buy!,"It is a super phone in this price range . It camera is good. Display is good. In first time the battery
Is not in function in after 2 days the battery is very good. In full charge it leads in 2 days . It is good performance and good quality . Display is good . You will buy you'll happy. In this price Samsung galaxy F12 is better than anthor mobiles",5
10789,Terrific purchase,Wonderful product... good battery life.... nice display.... fast biometric... over all the product is worldclass but they should improve camera quality...# value for money,5
10790,Bad quality,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features.
2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing.
3. No hitting issue.


4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use.
5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.

.. . ....NO APP LOCK, NO COMPASS. ......

🧸 APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN.",2
10791,Good quality product,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.

Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad .",4
10792,Best in the market!,Very best phone for the price according to lg w30 and w31 model with same specification are costing more for the price it is best and awsome to use very perfect for office use i have stored 62 gb full of data but it doesnot hang till now very awsome for the price and battery stands for 2 days,5
10793,Pretty good,"As per this rate its good deal for me.
I like it because i am not heavy user or gamer so i like it.
Display is Little bit not because its not Amoled display.",4
10794,Great product,Review based on 2 weeks usage. Good phone overall. Decent camera. Good display. Very good battery backup. Samsung product query support claim gorilla glass but do not explicitly mention on their website.,5
10795,Wonderful,Good budget friendly device from Samsung specially packed with that 15 watt charger which makes it far better good in every expect if u are thinking of purchasing a phone for your family go for it without anh hesitation,4
10796,Highly recommended,Nice phone battery backup is very good back camara is good and selfie is good in day light volume is high and at last best mobile phone in this range under 10000 thousends👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
10797,Highly recommended,"An awesome phone in such a price, the battery life is also good the display is very nice, if u are thinking to buy it, just go for it because its just awesome",5
10798,Value-for-money,"This is a good phone.A smart phone useful to the common man. But since it is a heavy phone, it cannot be used flexibly. Airtel SIM -internet connection is poor. The camera is good. Has voice clarity. The display is good. Performance is better. Battery capacity is excellent.

This phone is recommended👍",4
10799,Fabulous!,"The phones look is not very good, it's a bit more thik and heavy as compare to other phones. Design wise not up to the mark, although features are good and even the quality of the phone is good
If you are a samsung fan you can go for it but if not you should definitely go for the POCO M3 it is better than this phone, it's display is full hd where as samsung F12 has only has hd display and all other features are same but inters of Design definitely POCO M3 wins.",5
10800,Absolute rubbish!,"Like it's camera is is like 48mp.
It's take too much time to charge.
I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung .
It's has very less features.
It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter.
It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.
I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG.",1
10801,Terrific,"Samsung f12 best build quality,heavy battery life,Knox security, advertisement free system,no heating issue,fast charging,no lag,unloacking very fast,90 hz display is more better than full HD display of Chinese phone,Dolby atmos audio...I think samsung show their build quality in their phones in all segments...must buy
...flipkart deliver boy is nice ..he waiting for me 3 hour...and good delivery ..thanks flipkart",5
10802,Very Good,Poor camera. No night mode. Nice lock app not supported. Rest is good like performance and battery life. Software experience is great,4
10803,Highly recommended,Phone look is awesome best suited for official use ...Firstime#samsung Thank u filpkart for speedy delivery,5
10804,Delightful,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality. Volume of the phone is very low. music or videos cannot be enjoyed and we can't here properly if speaker is on during call. Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it.",4
10805,Excellent,Good and fantastic and very happy and lovely mobile,5
10806,Moderate,"Camera is not good as campare to sumsung M20
And m11
Mic receptivity not good
Not good product on this range",2
10807,Nice product,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11",4
10808,Terrific,"Very good phone at this budget. After 10 days if usage my honest review are below

Pros
1. Very good build quality
2. Decent display
3. Very good battery back up
4. Decent back camera under good lighted condition ( for this price range)
5. Good sound quality while playing music

Cons
1. Front camera become little whitish in picture
2. During low light camera performance degrades",5
10809,Nice,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3
10810,Worth every penny,Very good product. Value for money. Battery back up is strong. Awesome display. Sound quality is very good and loud.,5
10811,Must buy!,It is a very good and velue for money smart phone....... best quality camera and best battery as well as bast display in this price segment ant it has exynos 850 it is a good processor of all rounding 👌 i use this phone continues 2 months and i really impressed it's service . It has Android 11 with one ui 3.1 . One ui 3.1 is a extremely good ui and my one of the favorite ui . So i extremely suggest you this phone,5
10812,Delightful,Good product in this price range but not so good for gaming ...brilliant camera..and nice performance overall nice mobile...,4
10813,Super!,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent",5
10814,Classy product,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.,5
10815,Value-for-money,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive.
Camera quality is good in this price point.
Performance is also good in this range
Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it.
Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it.",4
10816,Super!,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ...

10817,Hated it!,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

10818,Classy product,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.

•The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

•I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

•The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

• Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",5
10819,Value-for-money,"Review after 3 month of use:

1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5
2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5
3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5
4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5",4

10821,Very Good,Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended,4
10822,Brilliant,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof 😍
Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",5
10823,Good choice,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phone😇. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌",4

Battery with good performance based on 15 days usage, Warp charge is awesome it charges at less time battery discharge rate vs time gave a decent peformance

Worth for your money to buy this phone. Go for it

Please don't buy 5g mobiles, it adds up your budget and for that reason phone features will be less.

It's UI is worst, most apps work in browser mode bcoz of Android GO OS.... There many other things in this phone which are headache... No double tap as well, to wake up/sleep the screen

Avoid Realme bcoz it's customer/after sales service is worst , it releases updates without testing...

Not even a month ...

Battery with good performance based on 15 days usage, Warp charge is awesome it charges at less time battery discharge rate vs time gave a decent peformance

Worth for your money to buy this phone. Go for it

Please don't buy 5g mobiles, it adds up your budget and for that reason phone features will be less.

14395,Best Phone in this price range. I bought 6 Ram-128GB variant,"Amazing Smartphone, processor performance exceeded my expectations. Battery life is also outstanding, with heavy duty apps I m able to run the phone for almost 24 hours. I did not expected much from cameras, but it got an above average quality and I would recommend this phone for gamers as well.",5

14397,Highly recommended,Cool and smooth performance.. Better than m3 pro.. 50 mp camera is not bad.. Thanks poco for better experience..,5
14398,Super!,"After using iPhone for about 3 years now, thought to go for an Android and decided to go for this beast. Initially I was skeptical for Poco wanted to buy other Mi phones but later decided to grab Poco M4 Pro 5G.
Yes, I am satisfied after a week use.

Processor - Powerful
Ram - good memory management
Display - not repenting at all for not buying an Amoled
Battery & Charging - Just Awesome
Camera - It's better than average

Perhaps in this budget as of now this is the best. Just go for it.",5
14399,Does the job,"Photos are good but needs more software Optimization. The bettery is good but still my 2 years old phone gives more screen on time than this.
Performance is good but software is not that good.
That's it, it is a really good smartphone.
Battery:- I am getting battery backup same as of my 2 years old smartphone in this brand new smartphone (my old smartphone also has 5000mah bettery). So not that good.
Hope we get Android 12 as soon as possible with stable software. And get updates to Android ...

Using this for some weeks now. Device looks classy and clean inside and out.

There are other brand phones which are cheaper than this and with better specs. But I chose Moto over them as Moto phones are more durable and the specs of this phone is not bad at all for this price.

The stock android 11 experience is smooth, battery backup is good, IPS LCD screen is top notch (not comparable with AMOLED), decent visibility under sunlight.

In my subjective opinion, it is a worthy phone. I wo...

The battery backup is awesome, it gave around 1.5 days of battery backup, it has a massive 5000 mah battery with 33W fast charger in the box. It has a FHD+ IPS LCS display (it was good if it had Amoled) with 120Hz refresh rate.",5

Pros:-
Big display
5G chipset
Decent primary rear camera

Camera is very good..night mode works very well sunlight photos are also good, charging at 33w is also nice 5g under 16k is a good factor but speaker is mono and not very loud decent enough, screen is very good comparable with amoled , performance is also very smooth because of ufs2.2 and 4x ram and 6gb ram which is expandable",4
15602,Great product,"I am writing review after 10 days...The performance is very good as it has Snapdragon 695 5G Soc(with 5 5g bands support).The camera is also very good as it has 64 MP rear and 16 MP selfie. The battery backup is awesome, it gave around 1.5 days of battery backup, it has a massive 5000 mah battery with 33W fast charger in the box. It has a FHD+ IPS LCS display (it was good if it had Amoled) with 120Hz refresh rate.",5

Screen, Performance, Speakers, Design, Build quality.
Cons:-
Camera.
This phone is perfect in all other departments but the cameras are pathetic. Xiaomi is fooling consumers by marketing as 108mp camera, its output looks like 8mp. A software update might fix the issue, but Xiaomi is known for ruining devices after ota updates so idk. Rest everything is good. If you are getting this for 20k-22k then buy otherwise don't its not worth it.",4

16344,Pretty good,The phone is good but was expecting much better camera but look is realy good even battery backup is good. Just not very much happy with camera,4
16345,Slightly disappointed,Well for the price. It's not worth it. The camera is from an earlier model and too much software enhancement is used. I just wanted a real picture. I do know that even if it's 108 mp. The software could only manipulate to 12 mp. The design and build is solid. Do except an update on software of camera,2
16346,Fabulous!,"Using from last 6 days. Excellent performance and I think it is better than Xiaomi 11i hypercharge in case of price. This mobile comes with 5160 mah battery which is really massive and fast charging is excellent that it will full charge in 40 - 45 min. Also there is no heating issues in this mobile and running very smoothly with 120hz refresh rate. Video quality, audio quality , gaming experience is excellent. Also I love the pacific pearl color which gives satisfaction when we look it.",5

Display is awesome, 90 hz actually works. Viewing angles are also good and there is no colour shift.

Performance is very fast, G88 works too good in daily tasks.
Ram management is not great but it is ok for overall perspective.
Battery takes about 2 hrs to charge from 20-100% and lasts 1 day easily and 1.25 days when u turn on power marathon. Warms little bit but no overheat...

16937,Very Good,"Review after 10 days..
Display is awesome, 90 hz actually works. Viewing angles are also good and there is no colour shift.
Camera is good, tries to capture every minute detail even in low light because of wide aperture.
Performance is very fast, G88 works too good in daily tasks.
Ram management is not great but it is ok for overall perspective.
Battery takes about 2 hrs to charge from 20-100% and lasts 1 day easily and 1.25 days when u turn on power marathon. Warms little bit but no overheat...

Alarm quality is pathetic. It's actually a toy and completely useless.",2

Everything work as expected. Battery back up is decent and lasts for a day in a moderate usage not heavy. SIM card slot access is bit tedious and under the battery. You can make calls and respond for messages. Speaker volume is sufficient to make calls. Signal strength seems bit low in most of the condition but open space it works well. Whatsapp is a fake app and not working. ...

no problems so far.. and it doesn't give eye fatigue like laptop screen( without eye mode on too). just one problem they give 20A three-pin cable with this monitor which is not supported by our Indian household electric bord I had to use 20A to 16A adapter(100Rs) to us...

PROS:
75hz [through hdmi]
5ms response time
IPS panel [beautiful viewing angle ]
AMD free sync
color calibrated
cross hair feature for fps games
black stabilizer
headphone jack
CONS:
The main con is, 60fps videos in youtube will be choppy when you are at 75hz. This is the problem of all 75hz/144hz monitor. Basically you cant divide 75/144 with 60, hence the video will be choppy. turning the refresh rate to 60hz will allow you to watch the video smoothly . ...

if you want to buy a better monitor for gaming, try Samsung 24"" VA panel (curved) 144hz (price a bit costly) [Please note with HDMI you can go upto 120Hz, for 144Hz you need DVI-input]",5

This has 3.5 Jack for audio at the back but don't expect much from it. You can play songs but OTT stuff, you won't be able to listen without connecting speakers . The product comes with VGA, audio and HDMI cable., and it's pretty easy 5 min of self installation. Coming to its all white looks... Oh boy is this stunning...or what.? IT'S DR...

21149,Wonderful,"Pros:
1. Great screen, no bleeding so far.
2. Good build quality and adequate cables have been provided.
3. For an LCD display, color reproduction and accuracy are good. You might find slightly better options but it won't be worth wasting a chunk of money on - this one would meet the expectations of 98% of the people.
4. Thin and sleek; doesn't occupy a lot of space.

Cons:
1. Can't adjust height, view. I guess it doesn't come this cheap anyway
2. Bezels are too thick when you compare agai...

21570,Simply awesome,"The monitor is definitely worth the price. If you want an reasonable LCD/LED monitor with speakers, Acer is the best choice. Over HP, Dell etc. Fyi, the dimensions are not exactly 16:9
It's a bit more in length as compared to height.
Speakers are decent enough for 1/2 person viewing. It's more of an office use monitor than a gaming/movie monitor. If you want those go for higher end models",5

21626,It's fine,"It was good doesn't look like a true LED. It's just LCD with LED Backlit. Using HDMI Cable brings a feel of full HD on the screen. But there is one defect that I don't like at all, as it was present in my last DELL monitor (about the same price range) too. It is that the screen is half dark on the upper half and light on the lower half. The more you tilt the monitor vertically up or down, the more you can see the differences.",4

22327,Pretty good,"Very important: Dell should change the non-standard plug on the power cord from 16A to 5A.

Workaround: I am using my old monitor's power cable for my sockets. Otherwise, use old PSU cable or buy a 16A to 5A adapter. (A = amperes or amps)


Despite the fact that the monitor supports FreeSync, it's not suitable for gaming as there is ghosting.

If you come from higher resolution + High DPI monitors then you may not want to buy a 27 inch 1080p monitor. You can opt for the 24 inch model.

Good for all daily use scenarios. I enjoy watching movies on it. I don't game so can't say about that. I use it primar...

Out of the box, plug and play, hassle free installation. Jumping from the 14"" laptop (which is connected to BENQ monitor via HDMI) feels great. A wide experience with eye protection that made my day.

Talking about the product, it has a FHD display with very thin bezels and much lesser light bleed. No height adjustment but vertical viewing angle can be adjusted to suit your needs. Product comes with HDMI cable in the box so don't bother about buying one. Run Pixel check and ...

22880,The power cable is the worst.,"It's probably a great monitor. I can't turn it on because of the power cable.
It's a large 16A power cable.
It doesn't fit in most places in India.
Is it too much to provide an adaptor with this monitor if you're selling in India where this cable won't fit?
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Thanks, BenQ.",1

22918,Good quality product,"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!",4
22919,Great product,Nice and Amazing Product the best part is it got delivered the very next day. It is working very well till now and i am very happy with the product.,5

22921,Delightful,"Budget monitor with best visual experience. Any kind of high end video it plays smoothly from HD to UHD, the picture modes are very good. Color definitions are good color differentiation is also very good, but one issue is there and that is the sound of the monitor. Don't depend on the inbuilt speakers of the monitor the sounds are very low but the sound quality is good. I would suggest this monitor without a second thought.",4
22922,Delightful,"Thin bezels , Awesome over all look, good price(7500rs) , 2 HDMI ports and speakers in this price range. Worse sound quality(but yes there is a speaker). No HDMI cable provided. VGA cable comes with Package. And the Packing was so good. Not sure.. whethr its LED or LCD.",4
22923,Highly recommended,"Excellent quality. Very thin bezel with matte finish screen. Viewing angle is amazing and there is no light reflection on screen. Good design as well, since it got small dedicated cable line to hide it on back of the monitor. Great texture design on back of monitor as well for aesthetic appearance. 100% satisfied. Go for it!",5
22924,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5
22925,Good choice,My Description:- Product is best in this price rang and I will strongly recommend to you. If you ok with resolution doesn't mater. I would suggest 22' is best fit 1080p. if you go for 24' best option for 4k or with plain eye you can see the pixel in monitor since we are close to monitor. So your thumbs up if its helps..,4
22926,Beautiful Monitor,"Very simple and good looking design. Could not afford full sRGB monitor. But this NTSC 72% almost cover sRGB range. Didn't try eye protection capability, as it will hinder my work on photoshop. Over all vibrant colour. complete mat front surface, no annoying reflection. Cable manager behind the stand is good. Over all good experience. I don't play games, so refresh rate no matter to me. in-built speaker are not at all loud. But having in-built speaker in this price range itself is a plus. Wid...

23460,Nice,Not the best of hd display. I have an LG ips 21.5 inch led monitor. Hd display of that better than this one. Couple of inches of screen size should not make this difference.

23947,Brilliant,Pretty good quality. Bought for 8K. I got it replaced for the first delivery as monitor was defective. The second replacement delivery just arrived 3 business days. Acer support is fantastic. If you get any error while connecting to laptop just call acer and do the troubleshooting. The price on big billion days was 6.5k. So keep looking for deals.,5
23948,Wonderful,I got it for an offer for 8400. This monitor has AMD Freesync technology tho it has not written here in the description. The monitor is really good and 75hz for this price is kinda nice too. The blacks look pitch black if you reduce the black in the settings. Overall I would say this is the best one under 10K for gaming and editing. Only thing that is disappointing is that i cannot adjust the stand.,4

23954,Pretty good,Monitor stopped working after a month due to manufacturing defect.. I got replaced it by consulting customer care within 7-9 workings days. Now it is working fine n no complaints yet. Overall it is a good product.,4
23955,Awesome,Nice,5
23956,Terrific,Good monitor and gaming amd sync amazing 75 hz refresh rate good for home tv use and computer and Android TV thank u flipkart and acer,5
23957,Brilliant,Pretty good quality. Bought for 8K. I got it replaced for the first delivery as monitor was defective. The second replacement delivery just arrived 3 business days. Acer support is fantastic. If you get any error while connecting to laptop just call acer and do the troubleshooting. The price on big billion days was 6.5k. So keep looking for deals.,5
23958,Wonderful,I got it for an offer for 8400. This monitor has AMD Freesync technology tho it has not written here in the description. The monitor is really good and 75hz for this price is kinda nice too. The blacks look pitch black if you reduce the black in the settings. Overall I would say this is the best one under 10K for gaming and editing. Only thing that is disappointing is that i cannot adjust the stand.,4

no problems so far.. and it doesn't give eye fatigue like laptop screen( without eye mode on too). just one problem they give 20A three-pin cable with this monitor which is not supported by our Indian household electric bord I had to use 20A to 16A adapter(100Rs) to us...

25600,Good quality product,"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!",4

Color definitions are good color differentiation is also very good, but one issue is there and that is the sound of the monitor. Don't depend on the inbuilt speakers of the monitor the sounds are very low but the sound quality is good. I would suggest this monitor without a second thought.",4
25604,Delightful,"Thin bezels , Awesome over all look, good price(7500rs) , 2 HDMI ports and speakers in this price range. Worse sound quality(but yes there is a speaker). No HDMI cable provided. VGA cable comes with Package. And the Packing was so good. Not sure.. whethr its LED or LCD.",4
25605,Highly recommended,"Excellent quality. Very thin bezel with matte finish screen. Viewing angle is amazing and there is no light reflection on screen.

Go for it!",5
25606,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5
25607,Good choice,My Description:- Product is best in this price rang and I will strongly recommend to you. If you ok with resolution doesn't mater. I would suggest 22' is best fit 1080p. if you go for 24' best option for 4k or with plain eye you can see the pixel in monitor since we are close to monitor. So your thumbs up if its helps..,4
25608,Beautiful Monitor,"Very simple and good looking design. Could not afford full sRGB monitor. But this NTSC 72% almost cover sRGB range. Didn't try eye protection capability, as it will hinder my work on photoshop. Over all vibrant colour. complete mat front surface, no annoying reflection. Cable manager behind the stand is good. Over all good experience. I don't play games, so refresh rate no matter to me. in-built speaker are not at all loud. But having in-built speaker in this price range itself is a plus. Wid...

no problems so far.. and it doesn't give eye fatigue like laptop screen( without eye mode on too). just one problem they give 20A three-pin cable with this monitor which is not supported by our Indian household electric bord I had to use 20A to 16A adapter(100Rs) to us...

I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!",4
26358,Great product,Nice and Amazing Product the best part is it got delivered the very next day. It is working very well till now and i am very happy with the product.,5
26359,Must buy!,Best Quality Display at this price range. Using this as a secondary monitor. Colors are so pure and everything looks so amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone.,5
26360,Delightful,"Budget monitor with best visual experience. Any kind of high end video it plays smoothly from HD to UHD, the picture modes are very good. Color definitions are good color differentiation is also very good, but one issue is there and that is the sound of the monitor. Don't depend on the inbuilt speakers of the monitor the sounds are very low but the sound quality is good. I would suggest this monitor without a second thought.",4
26361,Delightful,"Thin bezels , Awesome over all look, good price(7500rs) , 2 HDMI ports and speakers in this price range. Worse sound quality(but yes there is a speaker). No HDMI cable provided. VGA cable comes with Package. And the Packing was so good. Not sure.. whethr its LED or LCD.",4
26362,Highly recommended,"Excellent quality. Very thin bezel with matte finish screen. Viewing angle is amazing and there is no light reflection on screen. Good design as well, since it got small dedicated cable line to hide it on back of the monitor. Great texture design on back of monitor as well for aesthetic appearance. 100% satisfied. Go for it!",5
26363,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5
26364,Good choice,My Description:- Product is best in this price rang and I will strongly recommend to you. If you ok with resolution doesn't mater. I would suggest 22' is best fit 1080p. if you go for 24' best option for 4k or with plain eye you can see the pixel in monitor since we are close to monitor. So your thumbs up if its helps..,4
26365,Beautiful Monitor,"Very simple and good looking design. Could not afford full sRGB monitor. But this NTSC 72% almost cover sRGB range. Didn't try eye protection capability, as it will hinder my work on photoshop. Over all vibrant colour. complete mat front surface, no annoying reflection. Cable manager behind the stand is good. Over all good experience. I don't play games, so refresh rate no matter to me. in-built speaker are not at all loud. But having in-built speaker in this price range itself is a plus. Wid...

5. If you find that after changing refresh rate to 75 Hz the screen get pixelised, then install a small driver of this model from lg website. Problem will be solved.
6. Backlight bleeding is normal in ips panel. Don't worry about that.",5

26477,Value for Money and Quality,"The monitor works quite well. It has been a week since I have had it and so far its good.

I had the 21.5 inch version of this one and right now the difference between the 24 inch and the 21.5 inch version is only around Rs 1500.

I would suggest the 24 inch version. Everything is the same as the 21.5 version and the colours work really well.

This is quite the value for money and quality.",5
26478,Terrific purchase,"Good product at 9k range. Received in just 2 days during sale. The product price varies a lot, so wait for the right price. It has 2 HDMI ports and 1 VGA port.

Very easy installation. Display is very good under normal conditions, but if there is bright sunlight coming through window etc. then display is not that good. It has pretty good brigh...

27066,Wonderful,"Not ideal for graphic design or any other creative work. because of the curvy panel make straight lines to look also curvy, lines are straight only from a particular distance and angle. Nobody can sit in a certain position for long, when you move a bit from the angle everything changes.
And the monitor stand is too weak, if you touch the monitor it will rock for next few seconds – which is super annoying.
Only good for media consumption and basic computing.",4

27232,Worth the money,"Good monitor at this price range
The monitor is LCD not LED
It's only provided with VGA cable not HDMI
The power plug provided with it is of 16 A type, we can't plug that into our normal socket (5A), so we need to buy extra power cord of 5A and an HDMI cable.",4
27233,Awesome,"Good monitor for daily browsing. Auto eye care technology with 2 hdmi Port. No hdmi cable including but a dvi cable in this package . Sound is very weak. But u have audio output near hdmi Port
I got it 7.2 k in festival day s . screen is good.also have auto detect input.",5

27236,Very Good,"After using for one day, I can say this monitor is fine but you have purchase a 6 Amp power cable seperately around Rs120, because the power pable provided with the is of 16Amp which does not fit the switch board.",4

27247,Unsatisfactory. Misleading description.,Nowhere in the description or on the box it mentions that 16A sized 3pin cable is included with monitor. That size is used for Fridge/Microwave etc and doesn't fit in a regular 3 pin socket. Can not use this monitor without buying a convertor now. Highly disappointing that this is not mentioned in any of the product details.,1

27270,Pretty good,It would have been 5 stars had it not been for the 16 Amp plug that it comes with which is not practical as most extension cords and wall sockets are 5amp. Other thing that i miss is height or tilt adjustment. Screen quality and built quality is good.,4

27293,Using since Two months..😍😘👌,"It's been two months since I'm using this monitor.... at first I was hesitant to buy BenQ because it was the first time I heard about this company... but I took a leap of faith and purchased this product... and it was worth it!
no problems so far.. and it doesn't give eye fatigue like laptop screen( without eye mode on too). just one problem they give 20A three-pin cable with this monitor which is not supported by our Indian household electric bord I had to use 20A to 16A adapter(100Rs) to us...
